# Minesweeper

This program lets the user play the classic game, Minesweeper, with a grid of any size and of varying difficulties.
The user is first prompted to enter the size of the map and the difficulty they desire, and then begin selecting coordinates for which they want to mine.
Should the user want to drop a flag, they have the choice to do that at every turn.
